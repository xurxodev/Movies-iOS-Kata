# Movies-iOS-Kata Part 1
Movies Android kata for practice Best Practices in iOS implemented by Jorge Sánchez (Xurxodev)

- We are here to practice Dependency Injection.
- We are going to use Poors man Dependency Injection.
- We are going to practice pair programming.

## Considerations 

Master branch contains already solved katas, exists a branch for every kata.

## Getting started

This repository contains an iOS application to show movies information:

The application initial state without dependency injection is ready to just start refactoring. 

## Tasks

Your task as iOS Developer is to **refactoring to inject dependencies**, only singleton dependencies.
The recommendation for this exercise is:

* Before starting
1. Fork this repository and Checkout `kata-di-movies` branch or download zip.
3. Execute the application, explore it manually and make yourself familiar with the code.

* To help you get started:     
2. Identify singleton dependencies.
3. Inject dependencies from one entry point. 
4. Execute the app and verify that all is right
